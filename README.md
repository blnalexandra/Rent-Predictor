# House rent predictor in India
Simple ML project using regression for predicting rent prices for houses in India

### What I used
- New Feature: Price per size to make predictions more accurate (price per square foot)
- Tried different regression algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor and as seen in the score results, Random Forest Regressor performed best

### Performance
- R^2 score ~0.90
- MSE and MAE values are a bit high due to some outliers that have an extremely high rent for a small amount of square feet, but either way the model performs well

### Notes
- First ML project
- Dataset from Kaggle: House Rent Prediction Dataset
