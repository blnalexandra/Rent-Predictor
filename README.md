# House Rent Predictor in India
Simple ML project using regression for predicting rent prices for houses in India

### What I used
- New Feature: Price per size to make predictions more accurate (price per square foot)
- Tried different regression algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor and as seen in the score results, Random Forest Regressor performed best

### Performance
- R^2 score ~0.90
- MAE is not in the [0,1] range but considering rent prices can reach millions, an error of 2100 is not significant and the model performs well

### Notes
- First ML project using regression
- Dataset from Kaggle: House Rent Prediction Dataset
